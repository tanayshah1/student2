    "## Brief Overview:\n",
    "SASS stands for Synthetically Awesome Style Sheet. It's widely used to extend CSS (markup styling sheet language) and it compiles its code into CSS for styling HTML elements. It enhances and simplifies styling processes for web development, which makes it much easier to style projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Advantages Does This Have Over CSS?\n",
    "SASS has the benefit of nesting and also variables\n",
    "\n",
    "In CSS where you'd have to write out \n",
    "```\n",
    "id p\n",
    "{\n",
    "    attribute: value;\n",
    "} \n",
    "\n",
    "id b\n",
    "{\n",
    "    attribute: value;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "You can instead write out\n",
    "```\n",
    "id\n",
    "{\n",
    "    p\n",
    "    {\n",

    "## FrontEnd/BackEnd of Login Systems:\n",
    "The Flask backend of the login sets up special paths to handle requests for login and signup. From the user input, different HTTP status codes are produced, such as 200 for success, 401 for unauthorized, and 403 for forbidden. Other outcomes are JSON responses, which are returned to the front end, an example would be “login successful”. The Flask backend secures authentication logic, ensuring secure verification of login credentials. On the front end, HTML forms capture user input for login and signup, and JavaScript uses the Fetch API sends asynchronous POST requests to the Flask backend. The status codes and response data are then used to dynamically update the user interface, providing real-time feedback to users.\n",
