# Individual Final

## What is our Project:
We created a music streaming software replicating Spotify. As more people are creating and listening to music now than ever, other big companies are just wanting to make money with ill intetions towards their users. Our goal was to create a platform that allowed people to stream their own music, create and upload their own music; add music to a liked playlist, and more. It cuts out bigger companies that just want to make money. 

## My Feature
1. **Reply**
    - My feature was to create an SQLite DB that housed both users, the songs, and each users liked songs. We wanted the DB to be open to independent and individual CRUD features on each DB. 
    - In addition to creating the backend DB, I created both our frontend and backend code for the login page. We wanted to make sure that only registered users are allwoed to stream music. 


## Code + CPT Requirements added.

| Requirement | Code/Work |
|-------------|-----------|
| Instructions for input from one of the following: the user, a device, an online data stream, a file. (Ours will take input from a user) | Our project allows users to upload data or use the upladed data to add them to a liked playlist that is shown on the main dashboard. |
| Use of at least one list (or other collection type) to represent a collection of data that is stored and used to manage program complexity and help fulfill the programâ€™s purpose | Our information is stored into the backend repository where every song that is sent is uploaded into the SQLite DB. This is useful for us as a user will be able to listen to a previously listened song|

| SQLite DB containing all the users | SQLite DB containing all the songs |


| An algorithm that includes sequencing, selection, and iteration that is in the body of the selected procedure | The create method sequentially adds the current instance to the database session, commits the changes to the database, and returns the current instance, facilitating the persistence of the object in the database.
