## Revamped Homepage

| | I redid my homepage from the standard given by the student2 repo to be more personalized to me. I added several different aspects to it like a couple paragraphs, pictures, and a table. | | 

# Paragraphs

| | I wrote three paragraphs detailing some basic information about me. I included some of my hobbies, passions, intersts, and more. I talk about my passion for robotics and my thirst for learning. I go into depth about the awards I've won and the competitions I've participated in. | | 

# Pictures
