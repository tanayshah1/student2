## Reflections on Team Teach Topics:

### Understanding Internet Routing:
Recognizing internet routing as the invisible guide to our digital data enhances our awareness of the complexities behind online experiences. A grasp of these pathways contributes to informed user and contributor roles in the digital space.

### Digital Divide:
The digital divide emphasizes disparities in internet access, urging a collective effort to ensure inclusivity. Bridging this gap becomes crucial for providing equal opportunities in education, employment, and social interaction.

### Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Technology:
Balancing the benefits and challenges of technology is essential. Achieving a harmonious relationship requires conscious efforts to harness technology's positive potential while mitigating its adverse impacts responsibly.

### Crowdsourcing:
While crowdsourcing empowers collective problem-solving, ethical considerations, fair compensation, and the prevention of exploitation are vital. Harnessing the power of the crowd requires an ethical approach to leverage diverse groups' collective intelligence.

### Undecided Problems:
Embracing uncertainty and interdisciplinary collaboration are crucial in addressing global challenges. Acknowledging the existence of undecided problems prompts the exploration of alternative ways to navigate and work around them.

### Bias in Programs:
Algorithms' influence in our digital lives necessitates addressing biases to ensure fair outcomes. Algorithmic transparency and ethical considerations are vital for creating a digital landscape that reflects user diversity and values.

### Legal and Ethical Concerns:
Operating within legal and ethical frameworks is paramount in the digital realm. Balancing innovation with responsibility ensures a digital journey aligned with societal values, addressing concerns like data privacy and ethical technology use.

### Safe Computing:
Safe computing practices, encompassing cybersecurity awareness and responsible online behavior, empower individuals for secure navigation in the digital landscape. Education and awareness play key roles in creating a confident, secure, and controlled online environment.

#### Takeaways from CPT Project:

1. Conduct a thorough analysis of project requirements before development.
2. Enhance initial planning during the ideation phase.
3. Continuously update plans during development.
4. Identify and mitigate potential risks early.
5. Program in organized segments.
6. Use smaller, more organized code commits.
7. Organize code for better understanding.
8. Add descriptive comments to explain code functionality.
9. Gather feedback for iterative improvements.
10. Conduct regular code reviews for quality and issue identification.
11. Collaborate synchronously with peers for a cohesive project.
12. Adhere to presentation standards set by the College Board, avoiding mouse scrolling.

## CB Quiz Corrections 
### 59/67 or 0.881

### Q4:  
I am not sure what I was thinking when I did this. It clearly says intergers in the problem, so not sure where fractions came from.

### Q5: 
Another silly mistake. I think I confused the OR Gate with A and B with the AND Gate with C and D. Hence I put True and True for A and B thinking it was the AND Gate. And then True and False for D and C thinking it was the OR gate.

### Q6: 
Stupid Error, I misread the second rotate_right command in program 1 as a rotate_left which then makes program 1 null. However that is not the case. Instead both program 1 and 2 work.

### Q30: 
Conceptual Error, I misinterpretered how the second if statement worked. I thought that only if the number is under 10 will it work. The rest will skip down to "out of range."

### Q34: 
Forgot that left isn't the same as right. When solving the problem, whenever I got to the second iteration, I kept rotating the robot to the left. I didn't realize that the bot can't move left, only right.

### Q55:
I didn't understand the "top" and "bottom" number. However now rereading it, I understand it better. The top number is the height in CM and the bottom number is used as a counter for how many people. If the bottom number is 2, like I said it was, then the counter would be double of the true number.

### Q62:
I got answer B right, but answer D wrong. Again, forgot how AND Gates work. Since it uses an AND gate it means that both X and Y would have to be true. However this doesn't take into account the fact that one could be true.

### Q65: 
I completely forgot to pick a second answer. I am stupid lol.
