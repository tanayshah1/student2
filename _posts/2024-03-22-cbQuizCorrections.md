- The 2020 MC is the one I took last trimester
- I scored a 66/70 on the 2021 exam
- This is a sizeable increase from last trimester in terms of percent

- I tried to do this in my head, instead of writing it out 
- I also tried to guess what would happen and hence got confused

- Also tried to see if I could use a short cut and not try and understand the code 
- Just tried to use logic and proccess of elimination but honestly didn't work 
- Got humbled


# Popcorn Hacks: 
1. Binary overflow is when the number trying to be represented is too large for the set number of binary digits we have. For example trying to add 1 to 11111111 (255)
2. 
OR gate: 
def OR_gate(A, B):
    return A or B

AND gate: 
def AND_gate(A, B):
    return A and B
3. def multiply(x, y):
    count = 0
    result = 0
    while count < y:
        result += x
        count += 1
    return result

# Reflection

- My coding and logic skills are improving and the 2021 MCQ was a good source of help
- The amount of coding I have done since last trimester has shown a steady increase in scores
- Working in teams was very helpful
- Some concepts/questions like where they give a broken code and I need to fix it
- I am pretty happy with where I am at right now in terms of knowledge and practice test scores
- I am excited to see how this year goes for my skills
