### How work was split up:
Me along with my group memebers, Shubhay, Tanvi, and Pranavi planned features together and split up work based on the features.

I worked on the login/users database. 

### Table of progress

My feature is the login page authentication with JWT cookies as well as creating the database with two tables, one for the songs and the other for the users.
