This week, I created many things. I am most proud of the algorithm I created this week. This algorithm takes any stocks that you input and finds the most optimal weightings of each stock in order to maximise profits. It runs through 6000 different possible weights. 

This process was a lot of fun for me but it was really frustrating. I had to try balancing accuracy with trying to keep my computer from overheating and overusing it.
